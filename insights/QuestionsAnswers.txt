# Joshi, The Concepts and practice
## Chapter 1. Risk
1.9.4. A gilt (gov bond) and a corporate bond have the same principal and the same coupons and coupon dates. How will their prices compare?
[a] Gilts are less expensive since they are risk-free.
1.9.5. A bond can be converted into a share of the issuer one year from now. How will its price compare to the price of a bond with the same principal and coupons which are not convertible?
[a] It must be more expensive due to an embedded switch option.

# Chapter 2. Pricing Methodologies and Arbitrage
2.12.8. Show that if the current spot price is S[0], and the continuous compounding rate is r then a call and a put both struck at S[0]*exp(r*T) and expiring at time T are of equal value.
2.12.9. Prove that zero is the optimal lower bound for a digital call option.

# Chapter 3. Trees and Option pricing

# Chapter 4. Practicalities READ IT FIRST!!!
9.4.2. How does the graph of the Vega of a call option vary as a function of time to expiry?

# Chapter 5. The Ito Calculus
5.12.2. If the normal instantaneous volatility of an Ito diffusion X[t] does not depend on time, find a function f such that f(X[t]) has constant normal volatility. How unique is f?
[!] This can be used to uniformize the grid when solving the PDE. This usually improves the convergence properties when using the finite differences.
5.12.6. Show that S[t] is a solution of the Black-Scholes equation. Why should it be so?
[a] It is a tradable security.
5.12.7. Show that exp(r*t) is a solution of the Black-Scholes equation. Why should it be so?
[a] It is a tradable security - continuously compounded money account.

# Chapter 6. Risk Neutrality and Martingale Measures
6.17.5. In general, how will increasing the dividend rate affect the price of a call option?
[a] The dividend rate lowers the expected value of the stock in the risk-neutral measure. Thus, the call option will become cheaper.
6.17.8. Price a derivative paying log(S[T]) on a non-dividend paying stock following Geometric Brownian motion.

# Chapter 7. The Practical Pricing of a European Option
7.10.4. Prove that antithetic sampling makes all the odd moments of a sample of normals equal to zero.
7.10.6. An option pays 90-S[T], for S[t]<95. It pays -5 otherwise. Decompose into vanilla options.
7.10.7. Suppose two smiles have the same implied vol at 100. One smile is downwards sloping and the other one is upwards sloping. How will the prices of digital calls struck at 100 compare?
[a] The digital call is replicated by a call spread struck at 100: long 100.01, short 99.99. If there is an upwards skew, the digital call becomes more expensive.

[a] One possibility to price a discrete barrier is by backward induction by solving an ordinary PDE between the barrier lok date.
9.11.6. Discuss how a geometric mean Asian call option would be priced by the auxiliary variable method and by Monte Carlo (the geometric mean is the exponential of the average of the logs). Develop an analytic price. How will the price of a geometric mean Asian option compare to the price of an ordinary Asian?
[!]

What relation is satisfied in the Black-Scholes model with time-dependent volatility?

# Chapter 11. Forward Volatility and Callability.
3. Assume the following dynamics
  dS[t] = mu*S[t]dt + sigma(S[t],t)S[t]dt
for the underlying and deterministic interest rates r[t]. Suppose we want to delta hedge (via the Black-Scholes approach) an at-the-money call option. Construct the relevant replicating portfolio and determine its cost. Hence, explain why forward volatility is not so important for a simple call option.

# Chapter 12. Funding and Bias
2. Due to the huge supply of yen, the funding bias for USD/JPY is such that it is cheaper to borrow yen versus dollars. There is also a significant bias for dollars versus an emergency market currency, e.g. USD/BRL. Consider now a cross currency swap with one leg paying floating in yen (with no spread) and the other paying floating in Brazilian reais plus a spread s*. What would the fair value spread s* be?
3. Consider a flat Libor discount curve given by D(0,T)=exp(-0.03*T). Suppose that the OIS discount curve is D(0,T)=exp(-0.029*T). Compute the swap rate (annual fixed coupons, semi-annual floating coupons) for different maturities (1Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y) and compare with that obtained via Libor discounting.

[a]

Fixed leg:
K * sum_k dcf[k] * D(0, T[k], OIS) // annual
= K * sum_{k>0} exp(-0.029*k)

Floating leg:
sum_i dcf[i] * D(0, T[i-1], OIS) E[Libor(T[i-1],T[i]) * D(T[i-1],T[i], OIS) | OIS(T[i-1])]
= sum_i dcf[i] * E[Libor(T[i-1], T[i]) | OIS(T[i-1])] D(0, T[i], OIS(T[i]))
= sum_i dcf[i] * (D(0, T[i-1], Libor)/D(0, T[i], Libor) - 1) * D(0, T[i], OIS(T[i]))
= sum_{i>0} 0.5 * (exp(0.03*0.5) - 1) * exp(-0.029*i*0.5)


4. Since we forecast based on Libor, the martingale equation only holds for risky discounting at the credit-worthiness of Libor counterparts. As such, OIS discounting induces a quanto correction. In the developed world, it is common for interest rates to be lowered in times of crisis to simulate growth. As such, what should the direction of the quanto correction be? (Note that this is just a theoretical question, since such a quanto correction is accounted for by market quotes which are based on Libor forecasting and OIS discounting).
[a] During the crisis the spread widens and the rates are lowered, so that the correlation is negative. The quanto adjustment to the forward rates are thus positive. 
5. Assume deterministic interest rates. Derive the quanto effect of having a stochastic funding spread assuming that the asset follows a standard log-normal process 
  dX[t] = r[t]X[t]dt + sigma*X[t]dW[t]
and the funding spread follows a Hull-White process with constant parameters:
  ds[t] = k(theta[t]-s[t])dt + lambda*dZ[t]
and dW[t]dZ[t]=rho*dt. Hence, see that if the correlation between the asset and the funding spread is zero, there is no quanto adjustment.

11.13. Give an intuitive explanation of why the early exercise of an American put becomes more attractive as the risk-free rate increases and volatility decreases.

# Chapter 20. Volatility Smiles (p.443)
20.2. What volatility smile is observed for equities?
[a] Downward sloping. For currencies it is a symmetrical smile.
20.3. What volatility smile is likely to be caused by jumps in the underlying asset price? Is the pattern likely to be pronounced for a 2-year option than for a 3-month option?
[a] Jumps make the tails of the return distribution more heavy. The pattern is more pronounced for a 3-month option, as summation tends to make the tails lighter. IS IT TRUE?
20.11. Suppose that a central bank's policy is to allow an exchange rate to fluctuate between 0.97 and 1.03. What pattern of implied volatilities for options on the exchange rate would you expect to see?
[a] The tails of the distribution are very thin. Implied volatilities show the inverse smile.
20.12. Option traders sometimes refer to deep-out-of-the-money options as being options on volatility. Why do you think they do this?
[a] The volatility can not decrease their value too much, but can increase their value significantly. 

# Chapter 21. Basic Numerical Procedures (p. 489)
21.3. Explain how the control variate technique is implemented when a tree is used to value American options.

21.15. How can the control variate approach improve the estimate of the delta of an Americal option when the tree approach is used?
21.16. Suppose Monte Carlo simulation is being used to evaluation a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the volatility is stochastic. How could the control variate and anthitetic variable technique be used to improve numerical efficiency? Explain why it is necessary to calculate six values of the option in each simulation trial when both the control variate and the antithetic variable technique are used.
21.21. When do the boundary conditions for S=0 and S->inf affect the estimates of derivative prices in the explicit finite difference method? 
[a] http://www.ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Boundary%20conditions%20for%20option.pdf
In general, option are not very sensitive to the boundary condition except for 
barrier type option with the boundary very close to the barrier level. In this 
case, it is very important to take a boundary condition well suited for the 
problem as this option problem is extremely sensitive to the precision of the 
boundary conditions. For instance, in the case of an up and out call, if the 
boundary is not exactly at the barrier level and slightly above (in the case of a 
moving barrier that may not always be coinciding with the grid points), it is 
very important not to set the boundary point to zero for the nearest point from 
the barrier but to introduce a fictitious point in order to perturbe less the 
solution. In general boundary condition do not influence the stability of the numerical 
scheme but rather its efficiency and speed to converge.

[a] In the ratchet cap the cap is equal to the previous Libor + spread. More factors decorrelate Libors.

[a] In the sticky cap the cap is equal to the previuous capped rate + spread. Compared to the ratchet cap, the strike is always less or equal.

3. We can use antithetic variates to price Asian options. In this case, however, we need to be a little careful generating the stock prices if we are to achieve a variance reduction. You might want to think about this yourself.
