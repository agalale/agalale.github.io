<blockquote class='abstract'>We consider the inverse problem of recovering the spherically symmetric sound speed, density and attenuation in the Sun from the observations of the acoustic field randomly excited by turbulent convection. We show that observations at two heights above the photosphere and at two frequencies above the acoustic cutoff frequency uniquely determine the solar parameters. We also present numerical simulations which confirm this theoretical result.</blockquote>

<blockquote class='abstract'>The inverse scattering problem is considered for the two- dimensional Schrödinger equation at fixed positive energy. The results include inverse scattering reconstructions from the simplest scattering amplitudes. In particular, a complete analytic solution is given of the phased and phaseless inverse scattering problems for single-point potentials of Bethe– Peierls– Fermi–Zeldovich– Berezin–Faddeev type. Numerical inverse scattering reconstructions from the simplest scattering amplitudes are then studied using the method of the Riemann–Hilbert– Manakov problem in soliton theory. Finally, these numerical inverse scattering results are used to construct corresponding numerical solutions of the non-linear equations of the Novikov–Veselov hierarchy at fixed positive energy.</blockquote>

<blockquote class='abstract'>This paper is concerned with the inverse problem to recover a compactly supported Schroedinger potential given the differential scattering cross section, i.e. the modulus, but not the phase of the scattering amplitude. To compensate for the missing phase information we assume additional measurements of the differential cross section in the presence of known background objects. We propose an iterative scheme for the numerical solution of this problem and prove that it converges globally of arbitrarily high order depending on the smoothness of the unknown potential as the energy tends to infinity. At fixed energy, however, the proposed iteration does not converge to the true solution even for exact data. Nevertheless, numerical experiments show that it yields remarkably accurate approximations with small computational effort even for moderate energies. At small noise levels it may be worth to improve these approximations by a few steps of a locally convergent iterative regularization method, and we demonstrate to which extent this reduces the reconstruction error.</blockquote>

<blockquote class='abstract'>For many wave propagation problems with random sources it has been demonstrated that cross correlations of wave fields are proportional to the imaginary part of the Green function of the underlying wave equation. This leads to the inverse problem to recover coefficients of a wave equation from the imaginary part of the Green function on some measurement manifold. In this paper we prove, in particular, local uniqueness results for the Schrödinger equation with one frequency and for the acoustic wave equation with unknown density and sound speed and two frequencies. As the main tool of our analysis, we establish new algebraic identities between the real and the imaginary part of Green’s function, which in contrast to the well-known Kramers–Kronig relations, involve only one frequency.</blockquote>

<blockquote class='abstract'>We continue to study the problem of modeling of substitution of production factors motivated by the need for computable mathematical models of economics that could be used as a basis in applied developments. This problem has been studied for several decades, and several connections to complex analysis and geometry has been established. We describe several models of resource distribution and discuss the inverse problems for the generalized Radon transform arising is these models. We give a simple explicit range characterization for a particular case of the generalized Radon transform, and we apply it to show that the most popular production functions are compatible with these models. Besides, we give a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for solvability of the model identification problem in the form of an appropriate moment problem. These conditions are formulated in terms of rhombic tilings.</blockquote>

<blockquote class='abstract'>I consider an inverse boundary value problem for a model time-harmonic equation of acoustic tomography of moving fluid with variable current velocity, sound speed, density and absorption. In the present article it is assumed that at fixed frequency the coefficients of this equation are already recovered modulo an appropriate gauge transformation using some reconstruction method from boundary measurements presented in the literature. The main result consists in formulas and equations that allow to get rid of this gauge non-uniqueness and recover the fluid parameters using boundary measurements at several frequencies.</blockquote>
